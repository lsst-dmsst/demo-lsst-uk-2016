LSST Demos for LSST:UK 2017
===========================

The code for two sessions of demos are in:

* Lightcurves -- Examining a set of variable star, supernova, and AGN light
  curves sampled at the LSST cadence and with realistic LSST uncertainties.

* ProcessCcd -- Using the LSST stack to process one DECam image to obtain a
  calibrated image and a catalog of detected objects.

Slides for the talk "Getting Started with LSST" by Jonathan Sick are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.200418.
